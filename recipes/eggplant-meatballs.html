    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This plant based meatballs made with eggplants are so simply and delicious. The texture is very similar to real meat and you can eat with your favorite pasta.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggplants</li>
        <li>1/4 onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced frech parsley</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the eggplants in cubes and soak in water for about 10 minutes to help get the bitterness off the skin. After that, drain the water and let the eggplants sit for more 10 minutes with a little bit of salt on the top, this will help extract water from the eggplant.</li>
        <li>Mince the onions and garlic, fry in a pan with olive oil and add the eggplants when the onion and garlic are nicely golden. Add the seasoning: paprika, garlic powder, pepper and salt. Let it sit at medium temperature until the eggplants are soft, add a little bit of water if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggplant in a bowl and use a potato masher to get into a creamy mix, you can use a mixer if you want it. Mix the parsley and the seasoned bread crumbs. I have bread crumbs with italian seasoning and cheese on it, but if you have plain bread crumbs you can mix italian seasoning and parmesan cheese as well. Add more bread crumbs if you feel that the dough it's too moisture and you can't make ball shapes yet.</li>
        <li>Shape into balls and spray some canola oil on the top. You can bake, about 20 minutes at 400Â°F, or fry in a pan.</li>
    </ol>
